# About _The Mima Mercury_

## What's with the name?
The mima mounds found in Thurston County and nearby areas are inexplicable, lovely, and are part of essential prairie habitat for birds, butterflies, and other forms of life. [The Mima Mounds Natural Area Preserve](https://www.dnr.wa.gov/MimaMounds) has been an active research site for over 50 years! The mima mounds are an unusual local landmark, and are unlikely yet apt inspiration for this project. Let's create a local news publication as peculiar, vital, and long-lasting as those weird prairie mounds. 

## No rude paywalls
There should never be a paywall between you and important local information. _The Mima Mercury_ respects that. And you.

## No gross advertising
There will be no third-party advertising on the site, in the newsletter, or in other places. No sponsored posts, no pop-up ads, only small, humble, thoughtful information about things you might enjoy if you appreciate _The Mima Mercury_. See the next section for a more interesting explanation.

## Is there a business plan?
If there's no paywall and no third-party ads, how will this publication continue to exist? 

There are four main approaches planned:
- Holding both free and paid local events. This might include concerts, talks, workshops, or other types of events we haven't thought of yet.
- Offering products created by the team behind _The Mima Mercury_.
- A membership program called that allows behind the scenes access to the publication and discounts on events and products.

This combination of approaches is relatively unique in the South Sound, but publications in other areas are successful holding events, selling products, and membership programs to augment and sustain the publication.

More info about how to support this publication can be found below, and as the plan adapts details will be shared through the [newsletter](/about/membership/newsletter/).

## Who works on this?
Right now this is a one person project!

Seth Vincent is filing public record requests, conducting interviews, scraping data, writing code, creating data visualizations, making photos, and otherwise staying busy putting this publication together.

It's a lot. This will not remain a one person project. Your support is needed to be able to bring on the first additional team members.

## Will this publication last forever?
Forever is a long time. Local news publications are like restaurants. They fail. It can be an unpredictable business.

If production of the publication stops, it will be kept online in some form. Any members at that time will have their subscriptions canceled and pro-rated reimbursements will be issued for any long term pre-paid subscriptions.

Let's not allow that to happen. We need more journalists covering the South Sound and the state legislature. With your help we can improve local news for our region together.

## How to support _The Mima Mercury_

There are a few ways you can help make _The Mima Mercury_ continue to exist:
