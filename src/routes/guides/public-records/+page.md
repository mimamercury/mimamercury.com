## How to file public record requests
There's a great service named [Muckrock](https://www.muckrock.com/) that is useful for automating parts of sending public record requests. It's also great for seeing what kinds of requests others are submitting. For example, see the [search results for "olympia"](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/list/?q=olympia).

Here's a brief template based on one that Muckrock will generate for requests to agencies based in Washington State:

```text
To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:



------Replace this line with your actual request------



The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,
```

### Other resources
The Municipal Research and Services Center maintains [useful information written for local public records officers in Washington State](https://mrsc.org/explore-topics/legal/open-government/public-records-act) that is also quite useful for residents to get a sense of how public records officers are expected to respond to requests.

## What do I do after receiving the records?

Depending on what you're working on you may want to contact a lawyer or a journalist to assist you.

If you have already filed or are considering filing a public record request for something that concerns you, [feel free to send us an email to discuss the issue](/contact)
