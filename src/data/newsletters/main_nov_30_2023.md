## How does your favorite restaurant score in safety inspections?
This week I've added a new feature to _The Mima Mercury_: [a food safety inspection explorer](https://mimamercury.com/food-inspections) for Thurston County.

In this first release it only tracks the last 90 days of inspections, but it will update every day to pull in the most recent inspections, so you can check back any time.

By default it sorts by the total points a restaurant received in the inspection. This makes it a leaderboard of the recent worst inspections in the county. I have mixed feelings about this. Right now the establishment in the #1 spot is the downtown taco truck Tacos California. I love that taco truck. The inspection happened in October. There has not yet been a follow-up inspection to evaluate progress. I wonder what their previous inspections have been like.

There's a lot of opportunity with this data project to look for patterns in the inspections. I'd love to know if the Chevron on Pacific (a recent 0 score inspection) always gets a "no violations" result. Are there certain establishments or business owners that consistently get high or low points in inspections?

That's why the next update to the food inspections data project will include historical inspections data, not just the last 90 days.

## More data projects on the way
You may have noticed that this is the only thing posted to the site since the elections project (aside from keeping elections data up to date as new results are announced).

During this phase of _The Mima Mercury_ the focus is on setting up infrastructure for data reporting. The food inspection explorer is one type of tool that reporters might use to look for possible health and safety stories. But this isn't just for reporters, it's for any area resident that wants to understand where their food comes from.

The topic of restaurant food safety might not be the most exciting thing for some people, but here's why I'm excited: the building blocks I created for this project can be reused for similar collections of data. So the next time we need an interactive table of data it could take a day or two instead of a couple weeks.

As more of those building blocks are created and data projects can be produced more quickly I'll then start spending more time on analysis of data, other methods of information gathering, and news writing.

I'd also love to collaborate on projects where I and reporters from other organizations work together to create packages of stories, visualizations, and data tools so that a reader can learn about a topic in depth. If you're familar with [Propublica](https://www.propublica.org/), yeah, I'm basically trying to follow their well-established pattern of creating data tools and collaborating across organizations.

## Thanks!
Thank you to those of you who made contributions after the last newsletter! I am able to pay various hosting/service costs with that, which makes a big difference.

As a humble, grateful reminder here's where you can make a contribution: [Support _The Mima Mercury_](https://donate.stripe.com/4gw14n3GA8wheJOeUV).

## What's next?

- Making a lot of public record requests.
- Setting up non-profit status through fiscal sponsorship.
- Whatever you'd like to see! You can reply to this email to let me know what kinds of data projects would be useful to you.

Just like the spooky photo above, the road to a well-funded, impactful news organization can be beautiful and unsettling.

Let's see what happens.

Oh, and have fun with the [food safety inspections explorer!](https://mimamercury.com/food-inspections)
