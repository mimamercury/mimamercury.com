I trust you were not blown away in the wind this week, or by the large number of bills introduced by legislators.

While this publication is primarily focused on South Puget Sound, what legislators do impact all of us.

I highly recommend reading [The Washington State Standard](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/). They started publishing last spring and have great coverage of this year's legislative session and other state-wide stories.

Seeing anti-trans bills introduced in this session I wondered how these bills compare to previous years. The bills introduced over the cumulative 2023-24 cycle is the [most we've seen in the state since 2015-16](https://mimamercury.com/).

Legislators are getting more subtle introducing bills that would harm trans folks. In 2015-2016 there was a slew of bills about bathrooms. Recent bills have used language about protecting the rights of parents and housing of inmates.

Will these bills make it anywhere? No, probably not. But it is important to track which representatives are filing these kinds of bills. Find one that's not listed? Have an old spreadsheet with similar lists from previous legislative sessions? Feel free to let me know! I'm always happy to collaborate on these kinds of projects.

There's other action happening in the legislature that may be included in _The Mima Mercury_,Â but most of my effort in upcoming weeks will be in adding new features to the existing [power outage map](https://mimamercury.com/infrastructure) and similar new projects.

## The snow might show up.

You might not be excited. I'm excited. You might be dreading being stuck at home. I ... also feel that way.

Here are a few upcoming events that look like a good reason to get out of the house:

- [How about a hike in Pt. Defiance Park?](https://www.wnps.org/ss-events/south-sound-pt-defiance-park-hike) - January 14, 10 a.m. to noon
- [Winter twig identification class hosted by Native Plant Salvage](https://www.nativeplantsalvage.org/events/winter-twig-id-field-class-2024) - January 21, 10 a.m. or 1 p.m.
- And if you're really up for adventure, [The Salmon Coalition is planting saplings along the Dungeness River](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1vcOpjrfrR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)

Right, those are all outdoor activities. I'm excited about that. Maybe you're not! Here's some that happen indoors:

- [Mixtape exchange at Lantern Records](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1qSyrIRDir/) - January 14, 5 p.m.
- [Tell a true personal story about "hustle" at StoryOly](https://www.facebook.com/events/922708669418102/) - January 16, 7-10 p.m.
- [Marvelous Marine Mammals Exhibit: Free Admission Day at Puget Sound Estuarium](https://pugetsoundestuarium.org/events/plankton-free-admission-day-462-416-831/) - January 19, 6-7:30 p.m.
- [Make a zine at the Olympia Library!](https://olyarts.org/event/drop-in-zine-workshop/) - January 20, 2-4 p.m.
- [Beginner knitter series at Arbutus Folk School](https://www.campusce.net/arbutus/course/course.aspx?C=288&pc=8&mc=0&sc=0) - January 20, 6-9 p.m.

Just make sure it's safe to drive!

If the rain, snow, and wind just get to be too much to leave the house for events, you might check out the [habitat steward training](https://habitatstewardsnwf.brownpapertickets.com/) to learn about rain gardens, gardening for wildlife, invasive plants, habitat restoration, PNW ecology, volunteering, and other fun outdoor activities. It's held on Zoom, so you can sip hot chocolate while trees fall over.

If trees do fall over near you consider this an open invitation to email for help. I like storms, and I like when neighbors work together to clean up afterward.
