As of the latest election count update, 27 people in Thurston County, WA chose to send in blank ballots. Why have they done this?

Were these people engaging in a [protest vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_vote)? Maybe? There don't seem to be individuals or groups encouraging that tactic this year in Thurston County, WA.

The best theory I've come up with involves social pressure.

These 12 people don't care about elections, but they also know that the State of Washington [provides a way to look up someone's voting history](/posts/look_up_voting_history_nov_8_2023/) based on their birthday and first/last names.

Peer pressure works on these people, but only enough to lie about it.
