Improperly installed air intake and exhaust venting is the cause of the carbon monoxide leak that killed one student and hospitalized two others at The Evergreen State College on December 11, 2023 according to a Washington State Patrol release published March 13, 2024.

The timeline released by WSP indicates that carbon monoxide alarms sounded andc were silenced three times on Dec. 11 from 5:41 a.m. to 10:11 a.m. The contracted supplier of the alarm recommended cleaning the alarms at 8:49 a.m., arrived to troubleshoot at 6:16 p.m. and reinstalled or reset the alarms at around 7 p.m.

The alarms sounded a fourth time at 7:29 p.m.

The WSP timeline's only mention of checking for carbon monoxide leaks ocurred at 8:04 p.m., when a residential maintenance worker told TESC dispatch they were checking for possible leaks. Shortly after that they notified dispatch of seeing two people in distress and opened windows for ventilation. A TESC officer arrived in two minutes and the fire department arrived at 8:20 p.m.
