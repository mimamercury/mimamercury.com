## Senate Bill 6026: Require students to use names on birth certificates in schools

The stated goal of this bill is to "protect the rights of children, families, and teachers, and maintain order in K-12 public schools."

The bill is designed to do this through these means:

- An employee or contractor may not use a name to address a student other than the name listed on a student's birth certificate, or derivatives thereof, without the written permission of a student's parents or guardians.
- An employee or contractor may not use a pronoun in addressing a student that is different from that student's biological sex without the written permission of a student's parents or guardians.
- An employee or contractor operating in this state, when acting in the course of his or her official duties, shall not carry out any act or communication that would violate (a) or (b) of this subsection.
- A public school or school district may not require an employee or contractor to use a pronoun that does not match a person's biological sex if contrary to the employee's or contractor's religious or moral convictions.

The bill also states:
- Nothing in this section prohibits an employee or contractor from discussing any matters of public concern outside the context of their official duties.
- Any aggrieved individual under this section may seek relief through the office for civil rights at the United States department of education, or bring a private right of action against any public school or school district engaged in such prohibited discrimination, or both.

- Introduced by [Mike Padden (R)](http://mikepadden.src.wastateleg.org/), [Jim McCune (R)](http://jimmccune.src.wastateleg.org/), and [Phil Fortunato (R)](http://philfortunato.src.wastateleg.org/)

## House Bill 2241: Make gender transition treatments illegal for minors
Health care providers would be prohibited from providing these treatments under this bill:

- Prescribing or administering testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone to a minor in an amount greater than would normally be produced endogenously in a healthy individual of that individual's age and sex
- Performing surgeries that sterilize, including castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy
- Performing surgeries that artificially construct tissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs from the individual's sex including metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty
Removing any healthy or nondiseased body part or tissue.
