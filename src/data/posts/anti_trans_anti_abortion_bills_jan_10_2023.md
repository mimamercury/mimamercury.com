_**Jan 11, 2024:** Updated to add comparisons to anti-trans bills from previous sessions of legislature._

Legislative bills were introduced this week that would make performing abortions on others a felony, prohibit gender-affirming care, and require students to be called by their given names in school.

Over the past 10 years no anti-trans bills have been passed by legislature. Washington has passed multiple abortion protection bills since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

The bills are compiled here as a resource to track which representatives are introducing these kinds of bills and how far the bills make it through the legislature. Based on the outcome of previous legislative sessions it is unlikely these newly-introduced bills will pass through the legislative process.

In the combined 2023-2024 legislative sessions this is the most anti-trans bills representatives have introduced since the 2015-2016 sessions.

In odd-numbered years bills that aren't acted on are carried over to even years. [More details about the legislative process](https://leg.wa.gov/legislature/Pages/Overview.aspx#carryover).

## Senate Bill 6026: Require students to use names on birth certificates in schools

The stated goal of this bill is to "protect the rights of children, families, and teachers, and maintain order in K-12 public schools."

The bill is designed to do this through these means:

- An employee or contractor may not use a name to address a student other than the name listed on a student's birth certificate, or derivatives thereof, without the written permission of a student's parents or guardians.
- An employee or contractor may not use a pronoun in addressing a student that is different from that student's biological sex without the written permission of a student's parents or guardians.
- An employee or contractor operating in this state, when acting in the course of his or her official duties, shall not carry out any act or communication that would violate (a) or (b) of this subsection.
- A public school or school district may not require an employee or contractor to use a pronoun that does not match a person's biological sex if contrary to the employee's or contractor's religious or moral convictions.

The bill also states:
- Nothing in this section prohibits an employee or contractor from discussing any matters of public concern outside the context of their official duties.
- Any aggrieved individual under this section may seek relief through the office for civil rights at the United States department of education, or bring a private right of action against any public school or school district engaged in such prohibited discrimination, or both.

- Introduced by [Mike Padden (R)](http://mikepadden.src.wastateleg.org/), [Jim McCune (R)](http://jimmccune.src.wastateleg.org/), and [Phil Fortunato (R)](http://philfortunato.src.wastateleg.org/)

## House Bill 2241: Make gender-affirming care illegal for minors
Health care providers would be prohibited from providing these treatments under this bill:

- Prescribing or administering gonadotropin-releasing hormoneanalogues or other synthetic drugs used to stop luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, synthetic antiandrogen drugs used to block the androgen receptor, or any drug to suppress or delay normal puberty
- Prescribing or administering testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone to a minor in an amount greater than would normally be produced endogenously in a healthy individual of that individual's age and sex
- Performing surgeries that sterilize, including castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy
- Performing surgeries that artificially construct tissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs from the individual's sex including metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty
Removing any healthy or nondiseased body part or tissue.
