All you need is someone's birthday and first and last names to check out their voting history.

The State of Washington [Voter Portal](https://voter.votewa.gov/WhereToVote.aspx) doesn't indicate that you can look up voting histories other than your own, but you absolutely can.

Today I learned my younger sister has voted more times than me.

Is Washington's voter portal intended to be used this way? Probably not? Finding out people's birthdays is often easy. This portal also shares current address information. This _could_ be used in harmful ways, though this information and more is freely available for every voter in the state via the [Washington State Voter Registration Database](https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/data-research/washington-state-voter-registration-database-vrdb).

It's not possible to see _how_ someone voted – that would be absurd – only a list of elections they voted in.

If you have friends or family that you need to convince to vote, here's another peer pressure method you can use. It's not perfect, though. They might just start [sending in blank ballots](/posts/blank_ballots_nov_8_2023).
